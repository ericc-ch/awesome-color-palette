## Key Considerations When Choosing

Selecting a color scheme is personal but also functionally critical. Consider:

- **Readability and Eye Comfort:** Can you comfortably read code for extended periods? Themes like Solarized and Everforest prioritize this with concepts like "selective contrast" or "soft contrast". Pastel tones (Gruvbox, Nord, Catppuccin) are also used for gentler experiences.
- **Contrast and Accessibility (WCAG):** Sufficient contrast is crucial. Some themes like Kanagawa adhere to WCAG ratios (e.g., 4.5:1 for normal text). Others offer high-contrast or colorblind variants (GitHub themes, Night Owl).
- **Syntax Highlighting Effectiveness:** Colors should differentiate syntactic elements effectively to make code easier to parse. Gruvbox and Nord emphasize distinguishability.
- **Application and Ecosystem Support:** Visual consistency across tools is desirable. Themes like Dracula, Nord, Catppuccin, and Ros√© Pine have extensive porting efforts.
- **Personal Aesthetic:** The theme should resonate with your taste and desired mood (e.g., Gruvbox's "retro groove", Nord's "arctic" elegance, Catppuccin's "soothing pastel" warmth, Ros√© Pine's "soho vibes").
